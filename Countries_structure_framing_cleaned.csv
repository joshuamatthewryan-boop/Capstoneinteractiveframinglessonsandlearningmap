MENA,Hybrid,Dual Framing: Niyyah with Secular Objectives,"A pedagogical practice of layering two frames: an ""outer"" secular frame (e.g., a state-mandated Learning Objective) and an ""inner"" spiritual frame (niyyah). The teacher and students fulfill the official objective while privately or collectively holding a deeper, faith-based intention for the learning.",Modern Islamic schools that must adhere to a national curriculum; Muslim teachers in public/state schools seeking to integrate their faith into their practice.,Anonymous (Practitioner adaptation).,Pragmatic integrationism. Seeks to harmonize the perceived demands of secular educational standards with the spiritual requirements of an Islamic worldview.,"The teacher might display the official objective on the board but begin the class with a quiet moment for niyyah. E.g., ""Okay class, the board says our objective is to 'analyze the causes of WWI.' Let's take a moment and make our niyyah to learn this history so we can better understand the causes of conflict and be peacemakers in the world.""","Allows the teacher to meet curriculum standards (e.g., teaching critical analysis of historical sources) while simultaneously framing the lesson with an Islamic ethical purpose (e.g., the duty to pursue truth and stand against injustice).","(d practitioner ethos) ""We teach them the curriculum, but we frame it for their souls.""","Advantages:  A powerful tool for identity formation and values-based education in a pluralistic context. Allows students to see their secular studies as part of a meaningful, integrated life.   - Can create a cognitive dissonance or a ""hidden curriculum"" if not handled transparently.

For example, a unit on environmental science might be framed by the Qur'anic concept of khalifah (stewardship of the Earth), with niyyah being the intention to fulfill this sacred trust.",The curriculum is designed from the ground up to show how humanities subjects are integral to developing an Islamic worldview. The study of history becomes the study of sunan Allah fi'l-khalq (the patterns of God in creation).,"(d academic principle) ""The aim is not to 'Islamize' secular knowledge, but to derive a holistic curriculum from the foundational principles of the Islamic worldview itself."""," Offers a coherent, authentic, and intellectually robust alternative to simply layering religious values onto a secular curriculum.

MENA,Historical,Niyyah (نِيَّة) as Ethical Prerequisite,The foundational adab (ethical ideal and recommended practice) of framing any educational act with a sincere intention (niyyah). This act of purification elevates learning from a merely virtuous or permissible act into a spiritually rewarded act of worship ('ibadah) and protects the learner from sinful motives.,"The transregional culture of the classical madrasa and circles of knowledge. Rooted in the Qur'an and Hadith and systematically articulated in the ""adab al-'ilm"" (etiquette of knowledge) genre of literature. Nuance:  The frame's purpose is to elevate, not validate. In classical jurisprudence, learning with an imperfect intention is not legally ""invalid"" (as a prayer without niyyah would be), but it is considered spiritually deficient and risks accruing sin if the motive is arrogant or worldly. It is a matter of spiritual pedagogy","Primary: Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Scholastic Elaboration: Al-Ghazali (Ihya’ ‘Ulum al-Din), Ibn Jama‘ah (Tadhkirat al-Sami‘), Al-Zarnuji (Ta‘lim al-Muta‘allim), and earlier works by Ibn Sahnun and al-Qabisi.","Teleological ethics. The ultimate purpose of knowledge is not instrumental but spiritual. The core concern is purifying learning from corrupting motives like status-seeking (jah), ostentation (riya'), or worldly gain, and reorienting it toward God's pleasure and service to the community.","A recommended (mustahabb) practice, not a legalistic formula. It involved a quiet, personal reflection or a teacher's collective reminder to purify one's intention before study, asking: ""Why are we seeking this knowledge?""",Frames the study of any subject as a path to moral and spiritual development.

JPN,Hybrid,Japanese Lesson Study (Jugyō Kenkyū / 授業研究) with Kyozai Kenkyu (教材研究) and Structured Problem Solving,"A collegial collaborative inquiry in which teachers study curriculum/materials (kyozai kenkyu), anticipate student thinking, and jointly design a “research lesson” (kenkyū jugyō). Lessons are framed around a carefully chosen problem or guiding question (hatsumon), with a planned board story (bansho), in‑the‑moment monitoring and prompting (kikan‑shidō), whole‑class comparison/synthesis of approaches (neriage), and a succinct consolidation (matome). The lesson is observed, debriefed, revised, and sometimes re‑taught.","Longstanding Japanese school‑based PD practice; described and analyzed in: Makoto Yoshida (1999, doctoral dissertation on lesson study in Japan); Stigler & Hiebert (1999) The Teaching Gap (TIMSS video study follow‑up); Fernandez & Yoshida (2004); Catherine Lewis and colleagues (handbooks, case studies). Widely adapted internationally since the late 1990s.",Japanese teachers/schools (documented by Makoto Yoshida; James Stigler & James Hiebert; Catherine Lewis; Akihiko Takahashi).,"Collaborative, design‑based improvement; sociocultural/constructivist enactment (lesson as hypothesis to test); emphasis on task design, anticipated solution paths, public representation of thinking (bansho), and collective knowledge building.","- Hatsumon (launch): pose one rich problem or guiding question that makes the day’s mathematical or disciplinary idea necessary and visible.- Individual/pair work with kikan‑shidō: students try approaches; teacher circulates to probe, select cases, and ready the board plan.- Neriage (compare/polish): sequence selected student solutions, contrast, and connect ideas publicly on the board to surface the target concept/strategy.- Matome (summary): teacher or students articulate the takeaway and its conditions of use; assign brief practice/extension if appropriate.- Hansei (brief reflection): students note what idea/strategy they will use next time.","- Social Studies/History: research lesson framed by an inquiry question (e.g., “Why might different groups see this event differently?”). Students analyze contrasting sources; teacher sequences share‑outs to compare criteria (context, corroboration, perspective); class co‑constructs and records the criteria on the board; quick written matome captures the standard.- Literature: present a short text with a prompt (e.g., “Which interpretation is better supported?”). Students annotate, then share contrasting claims; board records moves (device → effect → evidence → warrant); matome states the analytic pattern.","“Lesson study is the systematic investigation of classroom practice, with the aim of improvement.” — Yoshida (1999). “The key feature of the Japanese system is that teachers study their lessons.” — (commonly cited in discussions following Stigler & Hiebert, 1999).","Advantages:  Strongly parallels formative assessment (eliciting evidence, comparing solutions), Hattie’s teacher clarity (matome), and Biggs’ alignment (tight task–goal–assessment coherence). Advantages:  The public record of thinking (bansho) supports both teacher decision‑making and student sense‑making. − Risks of “lesson study lite” (planning meetings without deep kyozai kenkyu, or showpiece lessons without honest debrief). − Time‑intensive; depends on substantial content knowledge to anticipate student responses and craft neriage.","No statutory mandate; widely institutionalized in Japanese schools through research themes, open lessons, and district/school calendars that support it.",Collaborative Professional Inquiry / Teaching Through Problem Solving / Public Recording of Ideas,"K–12 (especially strong in elementary mathematics, but used across subjects); also used in teacher education and some secondary settings.",

Not “knowing that,” but “figuring out how” in novel situations.","Curriculum design theory — central to Understanding by Design (UbD) Framework (1998, 2005, 2011) or Backwards design. Used in IB, PBL, Deeper Learning initiatives, and standards-aligned backward design globally.",Grant Wiggins & Jay McTighe — Understanding by Design (1998; 2005 expanded edition; 2011 version stresses transfer most strongly).,"Constructivist, backward design. Based on the principle that education should prioritize enduring understandings and transferable skills rather than rote recall. Learning must prepare students for authentic application (“life-worthy learning”).","Reframe lesson/unit goals as real-life applications: “We’re learning to analyze historical perspectives so that, in the future, you can evaluate conflicting information in your own life and civic decisions.”","Explicit: Instead of “List causes of the American Revolution,” a transfer goal would be: “Use historical examples to evaluate how people today challenge authority.” Encourages students to see history and civics as tools for present/future citizenship, identity, and decision-making.","“The point of school is not to learn stuff but to learn how to use that stuff intelligently — in new situations.” — Wiggins & McTighe (2005)
 “Transfer is the bottom-line goal of all education.”","Advantages:  Resonates with Dewey (learning as preparation for life), Bruner (spiral curriculum & transfer), and contemporary 21st-century skills frameworks. Keeps focus on life-long, authentic learning; avoids the trap of checklist schooling.

Teachers have high autonomy — no mandate to ritualize objectives at lesson start.",Finnish National Agency for Education. Interpreted by scholars such as Pasi Sahlberg (Finnish Lessons).,Holistic Advantages:  phenomenon‑based pedagogy. Focus on long‑term competences and inquiry. Resist reduction to micro‑objectives. Heavy emphasis on trust in teachers and local autonomy.,"Rather than “Today’s goal is X,” lessons may begin with a phenomenon: “Ilmiö: Ihmisten muuttoliike. Miksi ihmiset muuttavat maasta toiseen?” (“Phenomenon: human migration. Why do people move from one country to another?”). Students then set sub‑questions together.","History or civics taught via broad issues (migration, democracy, sustainability). A class might investigate migration in Roman times, compare with modern refugee movements, and articulate their own objectives.","“Competence is more than knowledge; it is the ability to use knowledge in authentic situations” (FNCC, 2016).   Pasi Sahlberg: “We trust teachers to decide how best to start and structure lessons.”","Advantages:  Resonates with Dewey, Freire (problem‑posing education), Wiggins & McTighe’s “transfer goals.”   Disadvantages:  Sometimes criticized for vagueness: without clear “objectives,” weaker students may feel unclear at lesson start.",,,,

Educational researchers such as Lars Erikson, Christian Lundahl.","Goal‑oriented pedagogy Advantages:  assessment for learning. Stronger embrace of transparency than Finland, but integrated with dialogue (samtal). Sweden imported aspects of AFL and Clarke‑style practice, but embeds them in Nordic democratic schooling values.",Teacher writes: “Dagens mål: förstå varför stormaktstiden kallas så.” (“Today’s goal: understand why the era of Swedish great power was called that.”). Adds success indicators: “You should be able to name at least 2 factors and explain why they mattered.”,In history or civics: explicit goals are coupled with peer/self‑assessment norms (e.g. “Two stars and a wish”; group dialogue on whether goals were reached).,Skolverket (2018): “Pupils should understand what they are expected to learn and what success looks like.”   Lundahl: “Assessment is not only measurement but communication enabling learning.”,"Advantages:  Closest to Clarke/Hattie language in Nordic region. Explicit objectives and criteria are transparent to students.   Disadvantages:  Some critique: risks narrowing inquiry into box‑ticking if misapplied; can clash with broader bildung values. Advantages:  Clear, student‑friendly daily goal framing. Encourages metacognition.   Disadvantages:  Potential over‑bureaucratization; less autonomy than Finnish counterparts.",,,,

An Essential Question (e.g., ""How should a just society balance freedom and the common good?"") frames the unit. A summative UbD task (e.g., a policy debate) provides an authentic assessment.

ISR,Current,National Curriculum with Stream-Specific Framing,"A centralized system where the Ministry of Education defines the core curriculum and matriculation exams (Bagrut). Daily lessons are framed by learning objectives (מטרות שיעור - Matarot Shi'ur) derived from this curriculum, but the emphasis and interpretation of these objectives differ significantly across the official educational streams (e.g., state-secular vs. state-religious vs. Arab).","The Israeli Ministry of Education. The system is designed to provide a shared core of knowledge (especially in STEM, Hebrew, and Civics) while allowing for the distinct cultural and religious identities of its major population groups to be maintained.",Ministry of Education (Knesset sets the overarching laws).,"Pragmatic Nationalism & Human Capital Development. The overarching goal is twofold: 1. To cultivate a strong national Jewish-Zionist identity (in the Hebrew-speaking streams) and shared Israeli citizenship. 2. To produce highly skilled graduates to fuel the nation's high-tech, knowledge-based economy (""Start-Up Nation""). The pedagogy is a blend of traditional, teacher-centered instruction with modern, skills-based reforms.","The teacher typically states the lesson objective at the beginning of the class. The framing often connects the subject matter to national identity, Jewish heritage (in religious schools), or preparation for the high-stakes Bagrut matriculation exams. ""Today, our objective is to analyze this poem by Bialik to understand its role in the modern Hebrew revival and to prepare for the literature Bagrut.""","The humanities are a critical and highly contested site for identity formation. In the state-secular and religious streams, subjects like History (Historia), Bible (Tanakh), and Civics (Ezrahut) are framed by objectives that reinforce the Zionist narrative and Jewish heritage. In the Arab stream, which teaches in Arabic, the same subjects are framed through a lens that seeks to preserve Palestinian-Arab identity and culture, often creating tension with the state-mandated curriculum.","(From the State Education Law) The objectives of state education are ""...to base education on the values of Israeli culture and the achievements of science, on love of the homeland and loyalty to the state and the people of Israel...""","Advantages:  The system has been highly successful in producing a skilled workforce, particularly in STEM fields, and has been a powerful tool for nation-building and immigrant absorption. The Bagrut provides a clear, high-stakes goal that drives academic focus.   - The segregated, multi-stream system perpetuates and deepens social divisions within Israeli society.

NZL,Current,Learning Intention/Visible Learning: Empathetic attunement/PCK mostly through The Intentional Alignment Model,"An evolved pedagogical design framework where Learning Intentions and Success Criteria are the central hub for intentionally aligning all aspects of a lesson. The model requires the teacher to align seven key components—(1) Success Criteria, (2) Cognitive Task Analysis, (3) Climate/Culture, (4) Teaching Methods, (5) Learning Strategies, (6) Activities, and (7) Assessment—with the intended level of cognitive complexity (knowing-that, knowing-how, knowing-with, or surface, deep, transfer).","This model represents the current evolution of Hattie's work, most clearly articulated in works like Visible Learning: The Sequel (2023). It builds directly upon the foundational ideas in Visible Learning (2009) but integrates them into a more robust planning structure, heavily influenced by John Biggs's work.","John Hattie. This latest iteration explicitly synthesises his evidence-based approach with the principles of ""Constructive Alignment,"" pioneered by John Biggs.","Evidence-Based Constructive Alignment. While retaining its empirical, pragmatic core (prioritising strategies with high effect sizes), the framework now explicitly adopts a constructive alignment/backward design philosophy. The starting point is not the content to be taught, but the intended learning outcome and its required cognitive depth.","Teacher Strategy (The Alignment): The teacher's core strategy is the deliberate, behind-the-scenes work of ensuring that if the Success Criteria demand ""knowing-how"" (deep learning), then the chosen teaching methods, activities, and assessments are not misaligned by only targeting ""knowing-that"" (surface learning).   Student-Facing Strategy (The Clarity): This alignment becomes visible to students through the classic LI/SC structure (e.g., WALT/WILF). The Success Criteria are carefully worded to reflect the required cognitive complexity: ""I can list the causes..."" (surface), ""I can explain the relationship between the causes..."" (deep), ""I can use these causes to predict an outcome in a new scenario..."" (transfer).","Crucial for making the implicit cognitive skills of humanities subjects explicit. Instead of a vague goal like ""analyse the poem,"" the LI/SC framework forces clarity: LI: ""We are learning to analyse how a poet uses metaphors to convey a feeling of loss."" SC: ""I can identify three metaphors in the poem. I can explain the two ideas being compared in each metaphor. I can describe the specific feeling that each metaphor creates for the reader."" This structure helps deconstruct complex skills like historical argumentation, source analysis, or thematic interpretation into teachable and assessable components.","1.

GER,Current ,The Three Domains of Education: Purpose-Driven Framing,"A framework that posits that any educational act must be understood in relation to three purposes:  1. Qualification: Providing students with the knowledge, skills, and understanding to do something.  2. Socialization: Introducing students to existing social, cultural, and political traditions and ways of being.  3. Subjectification: Supporting the emergence of the student as a unique, independent agent; their capacity to be an ""I"" who can think and act for themselves, not just conform.  ""Framing"" is therefore the teacher's conscious decision about which of these purposes is being prioritised in any given moment.","This is a major philosophical contribution to educational theory, articulated in influential books like Good Education in an Age of Measurement (2010) and The Beautiful Risk of Education (2014). It serves as a critique of the global obsession with measurable outcomes (what Biesta calls ""learnification"").",Gert Biesta.,"Critical Theory / Pragmatic Philosophy of Education. Biesta's stance is fundamentally normative, meaning it is concerned with what education should be for, rather than being empirical (describing what is). He challenges the dominant language of ""learning"" and seeks to re-introduce a language of educational purpose, risk, and democracy.","The Teacher's Reflective Frame (Not a student-facing tool). Biesta offers no classroom ""strategy"" in the way Hattie or Wiliam do. The ""frame"" is the teacher's internal, professional question before and during a lesson:  • Is this activity only for qualification (getting the right answer)?  • How can I frame it to also address socialization (e.g., ""How does our discussion about this historical event connect us to our community's traditions?"")?  • Where is the space for subjectification (e.g., Shifting from ""What is the theme of this poem?"" to ""What does this poem ask of you? How do you respond?"").","Biesta's framework is profoundly resonant with the humanities. It articulates the central tension in these subjects: Are they for qualification (learning dates, names, literary terms) or are they for subjectification (developing a unique historical consciousness, a personal aesthetic response, a considered ethical stance)? His work gives teachers a language to justify and design lessons that aim for the latter, more profound goal.","1. ""The point of education is not that students learn, but that they learn something, that they learn it for a reason, and that they learn it from someone."" (The Beautiful Risk of Education, 2014)  2.

(various writings)","Advantages:  Acts as a vital and profound corrective to the purely instrumental focus of evidence-based models. It re-injects purpose, ethics, and democratic values into the conversation, validating the unmeasurable but crucial aspects of teaching.  - It is highly abstract and offers no concrete, replicable techniques for classroom management or instruction.

The ""frame"" is the flexible environment itself. Rather than one single way to start, the teacher designs and communicates multiple pathways for students to engage with the lesson's goal:  • Engagement Frame: ""Our goal is to understand the concept of 'interdependence.' You can explore this by connecting it to our science unit on ecosystems, the alliances in our history topic, or the relationships between characters in our novel.""

(Using multiple media for communication, 5.1)","UDL is exceptionally well-suited for the humanities. It encourages representing a diversity of perspectives and identities (Guideline 1.3), which is central to history and literature. It allows for multiple ways to make meaning (Guideline 3.3) beyond the traditional essay. For example, a student could demonstrate their analysis of a historical event by creating a documentary, writing a series of diary entries from different perspectives, or constructing a debate, thereby honoring different ways of knowing and expressing. Specific History Example: connect prior knowledge to new learning (3.1); highlight and explore patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships (3.2); cultivate multiple ways of knowing and making meaning (3.3); maximize transfer and generalization (3.4); foster collaboration, interdependence, and collective learning (8.3); foster belonging and community (8.4); cultivate empathy and restorative practices (9.4)","1.

Based on the idea that thinking is a social practice that can be learned. By using routines to externalize and structure cognitive processes, thinking becomes visible, shareable, and improvable. It treats thinking not as an innate ability but as a set of learnable skills and dispositions.","The Routines Themselves. The entire model is a collection of student-friendly strategies. The frame for the lesson is the routine:  • For introducing a topic: ""Let's start today with a See-Think-Wonder."" (Teacher shows an image/artifact). This frames the lesson as inquiry.  • For activating prior knowledge: ""Before we dive into our new topic, we'll use a 3-2-1 Bridge to see what we already think we know."" This frames the lesson as an act of connection.  • For generating questions: ""Our 'Do Now' is a Think-Puzzle-Explore."" This frames the lesson as a student-led investigation.","The routines are exceptionally well-suited to the humanities, as they provide concrete structures for the abstract thinking these subjects demand. A history class can frame the analysis of a political cartoon with ""See-Think-Wonder."" A literature class can frame a character study with the ""Circle of Viewpoints"" routine. An ethics class can frame a dilemma with the ""Tug of War"" routine. They provide a common language for complex cognitive tasks.","1. ""Understanding is not a type of knowledge, but an ability to perform a variety of thought-provoking actions with a topic."" (David Perkins)  2.

The core strategy is the teacher's ""mindful"" and adaptive methodology, which involves:  1. Anticipating Misconceptions: Knowing where students will likely struggle with a concept (e.g., confusing correlation with causation in history) and designing a task to surface and address it.  2. Selecting Powerful Representations: Choosing the most effective analogy, metaphor, example, or demonstration to make an abstract concept clear to a specific group of learners.  3. Sequencing for Understanding: Structuring content and activities in a way that builds from prior knowledge and scaffolds complexity (Ausubelian/Vygotskian).","PCK is the essence of effective Humanities teaching. For example, when teaching historical empathy:  • Content Knowledge: Knowing the facts about the Great Depression.  • Pedagogical Knowledge: Knowing how to run a ""Circle of Viewpoints"" thinking routine.  • Knowledge of Learners: Knowing this particular class struggles with abstract concepts but responds well to narrative.  • PCK in Action: The teacher rejects a dry lecture and instead frames the lesson around analyzing Dorothea Lange's photographs, using a ""Step Inside"" routine to scaffold students into articulating the perspectives of the subjects, thereby making the abstract concept of empathy concrete and accessible.","- PCK represents the ""amalgam of content and pedagogy... that special form of professional understanding.""
